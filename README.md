## Overview

In this project, you will deploy a fully operational 5G network using OpenAirInterface (OAI) and Kubernetes. The network functions will be containerized and orchestrated within a Kubernetes-based microservices environment, ensuring flexibility and scalability.

The main objective is to utilize the Key Performance Measurement (KPM) service model within FlexRIC to collect real-time metrics, such as latency, traffic patterns, and throughput from the Radio Access Network (RAN). You will develop and deploy an xApp that integrates machine learning-based models or statistical methods to detect and classify anomalies in the network. These anomalies may include high latency spikes, unusual traffic patterns, and throughput degradation, enabling real-time proactive network management and optimization.

## Objective
- Deploy a 5G Network: Set up a fully operational 5G network using OpenAirInterface (OAI) and Kubernetes, with the network functions running as containerized microservices.

- Utilize the KPM Service Model: Leverage the Key Performance Measurement (KPM) service model in FlexRIC to collect real-time metrics, including latency, traffic patterns, and throughput from the Radio Access Network (RAN).

- Develop an xApp: Create and deploy an xApp capable of processing real-time KPM updates, performing anomaly analysis, and integrating with FlexRIC.

- Integrate Machine Learning: Implement models (e.g., Random Forest) or statistical methods to identify and classify anomalies in network performance metrics.

- Detect Anomalies: Focus on identifying anomalies such as high latency spikes, unusual traffic patterns, and throughput degradation.

- Utilize Provided Dataset: Work exclusively with the provided dataset.csv for training and testing the machine learning model, ensuring consistent and standardized evaluation.
